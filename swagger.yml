        Use this endpoint to create a new report. Report creation is an
        asynchronous task, meaning a job will be returned to let you know the
        progress of the report generation.

        You can poll the job to know when the report has been generated. You can
        create any supported report (see reportTypes for a list of supported
        reports). Ensure you provide the necessary filters when generating a
        report.

        All created reports, will store a copy of the data as a snapshot - this
        ensures that you have access to the raw data that was used to create the
        report.

        The Enrich resource enables you to retrieve details by passing in a search query containing a bank transaction description. The service enriches transaction data with multiple attributes, returning a transaction classification and three metadata components.
        The transaction classification will first determine if the transaction is of type payment, transfer, cash-withdrawal, bank-fee etc. The engine then derives merchant information, purchase location and prescribes an industry standard categorisation for each payment transaction.

        RegularSource
        Our complex income algorithm uses over 50 rules to identify different types of income sources. For example, to identify a regular income source - the fortnightly salary should have a minimum of 5 credits across a 90 day time period with regular intervals. Additionally, tolerances are applied based on confidence in identified income source patterns (by amount and frequency).
