        RegularSource
        Our complex income algorithm uses over 50 rules to identify different types of income sources. For example, to identify a regular income source - the fortnightly salary should have a minimum of 5 credits across a 90 day time period with regular intervals. Additionally, tolerances are applied based on confidence in identified income source patterns (by amount and frequency).
